# DNS Redirect Setup for AiThinkWise

## Current Issue
JavaScript redirects are not ideal for SEO. We need a proper DNS-level redirect.

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Cloudflare (Recommended - FREE)
1. **Sign up for Cloudflare** (free account)
2. **Add your domain** `aithinkwise.com`
3. **Change nameservers** to Cloudflare's nameservers
4. **Set up Page Rules**:
   - Pattern: `aithinkwise.com/*`
   - Setting: Forwarding URL (301 redirect)
   - Destination: `https://www.aithinkwise.com/$1`

### Option 2: Domain Registrar Redirect
1. **Go to your domain registrar** (where you bought aithinkwise.com)
2. **Look for "Domain Redirect" or "URL Forwarding"**
3. **Set up redirect**:
   - From: `aithinkwise.com`
   - To: `https://www.aithinkwise.com`
   - Type: 301 (Permanent Redirect)

### Option 3: GitHub Pages Custom Domain (Current Setup)
Keep current setup but add proper meta redirect as backup.

## Why DNS Redirect is Better for SEO

1. **301 Status Code**: Proper permanent redirect signal
2. **No JavaScript Required**: Works for all crawlers
3. **Faster**: No page load before redirect
4. **SEO Best Practice**: Search engines prefer server-level redirects
